### Tutorials
I highly recommend Git Immersion (created by locals at [Neo](http://neo.com)) for hands-on learning with the Git command-line tools. For these exercises, you can use UCFileSpace for [shell access](https://ucfilespace.uc.edu/wiki/search/Unix%20Access%20on%20UCFileSpace) and UC's [GitHub Enterprise server](https://github.uc.edu) as the remote "origin" repository, if you wish.

Neo's tutorial helps you install Git on your workstation (but you can [use UCFS for that][ucfs-git]), gets you up-and-running with a sane Git configuration, walks you through all of the common commit/push/merge operations, and even forces you to break (and fix) things in some of the advanced lessons. Each lesson is short, and easy to go back and reference later when you run into trouble on a _real_ project. Although the tutorial's sample project is comprised of Ruby code, no familiarity with the [Ruby language](http://ruby-lang.org) is actually required to complete the tutorial.

### Videos
1. [Webcast • The Basics of Git and GitHub • July 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8GBXvdmHT4) - a 50-minute webcast hosted by a GitHub employee that provides a high-level overview of what Git is, why you'd want to use it, and how GitHub.com layers extra collaborative features on top of Git <abbr title="Source Code Management">SCM</abbr>.
2. [GitHub Training & Guides](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCP7RrmoueENv9TZts3HXXtw) YouTube channel (check out their [video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y04-NzarItQ) for a quick chuckle)
3. [Jessica Kerr: "Git Happens"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dv8I_kfrFWw) - a 54-minute conference talk which explains Git concepts like branching, merging, and rebasing in a highly visual way. Good if you're compfortable with basic Git usage, but have always wondered about more advanced usage like branching and rebasing. If you stick with it until the end, you'll be rewarded with an epiphany about `git rebase -i`. Promise.
